# COVID-19 Data Visualization

This is a Windows Forms application written in C# that uses MSChart to display data visualizations from COVID-19 data stored in a SQL Server database. The application includes a pie chart that shows the proportion of total number of cases in the provinces and territories for a selected date, and a line chart that shows the number of confirmed cases and number of individuals tested for a selected time frame and province/territory or for all of Canada.
